# Rucio

##  Data Management for science in the Big Data era.

Rucio is a project that provides services and associated libraries for allowing scientific collaborations to manage large volumes of data spread across facilities at multiple institutions and organisations. Rucio has been developed by the `ATLAS <https://atlas.cern/>`_ experiment. It offers advanced features, is highly scalable and modular.

## QuickStart

Add the Rucio Helm repository to your local Helm installation and install it using:

```bash
$ helm repo add rucio https://rucio.github.io/helm-charts
$ helm install rucio/rucio-daemons
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a Rucio server deployment and service on a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm Package manager.

## Installing the Chart

This chart can be used to install Rucio daemons. Not all of the possible daemons are necessary to run a instance of Rucio. Some daemons are optional. By default no daemon is activated and they have to be explicitly started. A simple daemon instance with one judge-cleaner daemon can be started like this:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release --set judgeCleanerCount=1 rucio/rucio-daemons
```

This command will start 1 judge-cleaner using an un-initialised SQLite database. To fully use this chart an already bootstraped database is necessary. The daemons can then be configured to use the DB.

To install the chart so that is will connected to a MySQL DB running at `mysql.db` with the user `rucio` and password `rucio`:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release --set judgeCleanerCount=1 --set config.database.default="mysql://rucio:rucio@mysql.db/rucio" rucio/rucio-daemons
```

## Configuration

The default configuration values for this chart are listed in `values.yaml` our you can get them with:

```bash
$ helm inspect values rucio/rucio-daemons
```

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install` as shown before.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml rucio/rucio-daemons
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete my-release --purge
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
